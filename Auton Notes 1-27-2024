Auto 1
	Example Trajectory
	Goes Straight for 1.5 meters
	

Auto 2
	Produces a code error
	

Auto 3
	Place High Cube
	Balance on Charging Startion
	
Auto 4
	Place High Cube
	Moved 5 meeters
	And was supposed to auto balance
	
Auto 5
	Place High Cube
	Moved back in C motion to right
	
Auto 6
	Place High Cube
	Move back in C motion to the Left
	
Auto 85
	Placed High Cube
	Allison auto Balance on Charging Station
	
	
Auto 1 
	2.15 in bottom 1 trajectory 
	Moved 5.5 feet
	1   was 2 feet 3 inches
	
	So We entered 2 
	That equated to a 5 foot movement
	The robot turned 
	So we are trying other numbers to effect curve
	
	Translation 2d 0,0     x=1  y=0  This cause the robot to have same movement but do it faster
			1,0          x=1 y=0  moved slower
			5,0         x=1  y=0  did not move at all
			2,0         x=1  y=0  did not move at all
			.5,0        x=0  y=0  Nothing happene
			.5,0        x=.5  y=0  move just like before
			.5            x=0  y=0  Nothing happened
			
	New Test 
	
		.5 ,0  X=1  y=0
		Translation 2d  2, 1     
		Same distance forward 5 feet - moved 4 feet to the left
		
		.5, 0 x=1   y=0 
		Translation 2d 2,1    Rotation 1   
		SO the Rotation to 1 made the bot turn almost 90 degrees
		
		.5, 0 x=1   y=0 
		Translation 2d 2,1    Rotation  -1   
		Rotated the bot in opposite direction still moved to the left Same position
		
		.5, 0 x=1   y=0 
		Translation 2d 2,-1    Rotation  -1   
		Rotated the bot in opposite direction still moved to the left Same position
		
		List of new Tralation 2d x .5, y1      New translation 2 d x1, y0
		Translation 2d 2,1    Rotation  0   
		This made the bot go left 3ft right 3 feet then left 3ft
		3 separate movements
		
		 new pose 2d x 1, y1      Rotation 1 
		List of new Tralation 2d x .5, y1      New translation 2 d x1, y0
		Translation 2d 2,1    Rotation  0  
		This made the bot move in a circle
		Need to mess with this
		
		
		Translation 2d   X value (which is the2) is distance forward
		Translation 2d  Y value (which is 1)  makes it move left
		Translation 2d Rotation 2d 1 or -1 turns the bot
		Translation 2d entering -1 in the y moves it right
